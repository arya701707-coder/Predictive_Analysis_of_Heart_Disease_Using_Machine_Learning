# Predictive Analysis of Heart Disease Using Machine Learning

## Project Overview
This project aims to predict the likelihood of heart disease in individuals using machine learning algorithms. By analyzing various health parameters such as age, blood pressure, cholesterol level, and heart rate, the model helps identify people who are at risk of developing cardiovascular diseases.


### Objectives
- To perform data preprocessing and cleaning for better model accuracy.  
- To analyze patterns and correlations among different health parameters.  
- To build and evaluate multiple machine learning models.  
- To identify the most accurate model for predicting heart disease.  


#### Technologies & Tools Used
- **Programming Language:** Python  
- **Libraries:** NumPy, Pandas, Matplotlib, Seaborn, Scikit-learn  
- **IDE:** Jupyter Notebook / Anaconda  
- **Version Control:** Git & GitHub
